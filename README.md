-  **How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
	Proper testing helps to ensure that code is functional and secure. Through rigorous testing, expected functionality can be checked throughout development. This allows bugs  adn errors to be found earlier which often times makes them less complicated to correct.
-   **How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
The first step in interpreting user needs is indetifying what the software should be capable of in addition to how the software will be run. From that point it's important to view the software from the point of view of the user. It's then helpful to diagram the desired functionality before incorporating it.
-   **How do I approach designing software?**
I approach designing software in segments. I first break up the software into parts before incorporating them. I find this method inforces Object Oriented Programming and allows me to organize the code for myself.
